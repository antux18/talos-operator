# Reconciliation States

Each top-level CRD exposes a `.status.state` field that the controller drives through a small state machine during reconciliation. The diagrams below reflect the transitions actually implemented in the controllers — not every state constant in `api/v1alpha1/common.go` is reachable for every resource.

The `State` column is also surfaced via `kubectl get` (see each CRD's `printcolumn` markers).

## TalosControlPlane

Normal flow on a metal-mode control plane is `Pending → Available → Bootstrapped → Ready`. Container-mode skips the intermediate states and transitions straight to `Ready` once the backing StatefulSet reports all replicas ready. Kubernetes upgrades run as a side-branch that can re-enter from `Available` or `Bootstrapped`.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Pending: config generated
    [*] --> Bootstrapped: imported existing cluster

    Pending --> Available: metal — all TalosMachines reach Available
    Pending --> Ready: container — StatefulSet replicas ready

    Available --> Bootstrapped: bootstrap succeeds
    Bootstrapped --> Ready: kubeconfig written

    Available --> UpgradingKubernetes: spec.kubernetesVersion changed
    Bootstrapped --> UpgradingKubernetes: spec.kubernetesVersion changed
    Ready --> UpgradingKubernetes: spec.kubernetesVersion changed

    UpgradingKubernetes --> Ready: upgrade job succeeded
    UpgradingKubernetes --> KubernetesUpgradeFailed: upgrade job failed

    KubernetesUpgradeFailed --> UpgradingKubernetes: retry after user intervention
```

!!! note
    `UpgradingKubernetes → Ready` is implicit — the controller does not re-assign the state directly on job success; the next reconcile pass re-evaluates machine readiness and writes `Ready` through the normal path.

## TalosMachine

A machine is `Installing` while its initial Talos config is being applied, then settles into `Available` once the kubelet is running. A spec-level Talos version bump cycles it back through `Upgrading`. `Orphaned` is a terminal state entered when the parent TalosControlPlane or TalosWorker can no longer be resolved.

When `spec.pxeClientSpec` is set the machine starts in `Booting` and the controller polls the Talos disks API every 30 seconds until the node responds; once it does, the machine transitions to `Pending` and the normal install path resumes. Non-PXE machines skip `Booting` and `Pending` entirely — the controller applies the config in maintenance (insecure) mode directly from the initial empty state.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Booting: PXE — pxeClientSpec set, waiting for node API
    [*] --> Installing: non-PXE — ApplyConfig in maintenance mode
    [*] --> Available: imported existing machine
    [*] --> Orphaned: parent control plane / worker not found

    Booting --> Pending: node API responds (disks query succeeds)
    Pending --> Installing: ApplyConfig in maintenance mode

    Installing --> Available: kubelet service running

    Available --> Upgrading: spec.talosVersion changed
    Upgrading --> Available: kubelet service running after upgrade

    Available --> Drifted: watcher detects out-of-band node change
    Drifted --> Installing: desired config re-applied
    Drifted --> Upgrading: node Talos version diverged

    Orphaned --> [*]: skipped — reconciliation halts
```

`Drifted` is written by the external drift watcher, not the reconciler — see [Drift Detection](drift_detection.md). It marks a machine whose live node state diverged from the desired state without any change to the Custom Resource (e.g. a manual `talosctl apply-config`); the next reconcile re-applies the desired state through the normal `Installing`/`Upgrading` path.

!!! note
    On deletion, `TalosMachine` does **not** transition to a terminal state — the finalizer either issues a Talos `reset` (when the deletion policy requests it) or just removes the finalizer. `Orphaned` machines always skip the reset step.

## TalosWorker

The worker lifecycle is intentionally minimal: it stays `Pending` until every child TalosMachine reaches `Available`, then flips to `Ready`.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Pending: config generated
    [*] --> Ready: imported existing worker

    Pending --> Ready: all child TalosMachines reach Available
```
